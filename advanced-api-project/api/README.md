Filtering, Searching, and Ordering
----------------------------------

The BookListView API supports advanced query features:

Filtering:
- Filter by title, author, or publication_year.
  Example: /api/books/?author=Rowling

Search:
- Full-text search on title and author.
  Example: /api/books/?search=harry

Ordering:
- Order results by 'title' or 'publication_year'.
  Example: /api/books/?ordering=-publication_year
